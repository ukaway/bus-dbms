# CityConnect Bus DBMS
I designed and implemented a database that handles the data of a fictitious local bus company, CityConnect Bus! Timetables and data of customers, drivers, and bus fleets can be stored and viewed from this database. This database can be used by local transportation companies for various purposes like efficiency, punctuality, etc.
